# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on [Dataset Name]

## Overview
Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! In this repository, I have performed a comprehensive analysis of the [Dataset Name] to uncover insights and patterns that can help in understanding the data better. The goal of this project is to utilize various statistical and visualization techniques to explore the dataset thoroughly.

## Objectives
- Generate summary statistics to understand the central tendency and dispersion of the data.
- Create visualizations such as histograms and boxplots to analyze the distribution of numeric features.
- Use pairplots and correlation matrices to explore relationships between features.
- Identify any patterns, trends, or anomalies present in the data.

## Tools Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Plotly**: (Optional) For interactive visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the titanic dataset available on kaggle
